I remember some time ago I did that search in Google: "Should I write a blog in 2021?". Literally, like that.

Do you do that often? When you want to be informed? Or when you want to find out about something? Do you google it? Is the knowledge of humanity now dependant of Google's algorithm? When did "google" became a verb?

For this article, we don't care. Let's keep focused.

## Should you write a blog in 2021? Definitely yes

Well, at least that's **my** answer. That's the TL:DR; specially if you already thought about doing so or if by any chance you're reading this because you googled the same keywords I did, just do it.

You see, I have the theory that if you're thinking about doing something, you shouldn't just think about it.

You should do it.

Your ideas are callings. Or they could be. The only way to clear the doubt is to realize them.

## Blogs are dead

Who says so? You're reading one. And there're plenty out there.

I would say blogs aren't dead. At all.

They are eternal.

## Nobody reads blogs anymore

Yeah, it could be. Altough I think "nobody" is just too much, we don't know. The key thing is, and let me quote it:

> You shouldn't write a blog for others.
>
> You should write a blog for you.

## Why you should do it

Simply put, think about it as a journal of your work, or even your life. It's an investment of your time.

I started mazza.com.ar as the result of a long road I've been walking through; some of it I'm talking about in my Spanish posts. And I couldn't feel better about doing so.

The thing is, I've been always been a creator. And there are plenty of creators out there. But almost the majority of my creations were done privately. I didn't tell anyone what I was doing. Not even to myself.

Writing about something has the side benefit of reflecting upon it. It makes you think clearer, sort out the ideas, etc.

## I don't know how

I plan to write about my current setup with Hugo and how I blog but if you need any tip please feel free to reach out to me via social media or your preferred method (<a href="https://twitter.com/marcelomazza" target="_blank">@marcelomazza</a>).

Thanks for reading so far!
