    For years I've been trying to find a Job Title that would suit me. This is
    the best one I've found so far:
  </p>
  <h2>Optimizer</h2>
  <p>
    I used to have a website with bells and whistles, CSS animations,
    React/Gatsby, etc, but I decided to go back to the basics.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can check my
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelomazza/">Linkedin</a>
    to read about my formal experience but to speed things
    up (did I say I like to optimize stuff?) here are some bullets:
    <ul>
      <li>First computer: 1993 (just a kid typing commands in MS-DOS)</li>
      <li>+7 years of experience in top e-commerce companies</li>
      <li>+6 years (and counting) of freelance experience</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/marcelo-mazza">Toptal Talent</a> since 2015</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>What can I do for you</h2>
  <p>
    First of all, like people, each business is a world on its own. This is why
    the “one size fits all” approach doesn't work for everyone. This is why you
    need a UX & Web Design consultant (like me, of course) to take your business
    to the next level.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you think about what makes a good product, website or service, there are
    lot of variables for success but a good UX and a good implementation of that
    UX are key to stand up from the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    I combine my experience in multiple fields so I'm sure I'll be able to help
    your business somehow. I like to focus on metrics so let's see which KPIs
    you have and how we can improve your UX or implementation to improve them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's talk and see how it goes. There's a minimum rate which I don't publish
    because I live in a not-so-secure country :( feel free to write me and I'll
    tell you: ux@marcelomazza.com.ar.

  <p>
    Thanks for reading this far!
